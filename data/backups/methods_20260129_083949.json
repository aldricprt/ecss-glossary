    "procedure": [
      "Requirement Resolution: Define users, scope (LCC, SE), and available data.",
      "Data Collection: Gather costs with expenditure dates and WBS formats.",
      "Model Building: Select driving parameters with high correlation to cost but low correlation to each other.",

      "Logical Flow: Inputs should drive outputs; never \"force\" inputs to reach a desired price.",
