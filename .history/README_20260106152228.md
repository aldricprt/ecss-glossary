# Local Glossary — editable

This project provides a small local glossary application where you can add, edit and delete your own glossary entries (terms or abbreviations). It no longer depends on a preloaded ECSS database — you can manage your personal glossary directly.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+

Quick start (recommended)

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
cd /Users/aldricparent/Documents/Spatial/ECSS
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start the local server (serves the web UI and provides the API):

```bash
ion 
# opens on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

3. Open the web UI in your browser:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

What you can do
- Add new entries (choose type: Term or Abbreviation)
- Edit existing entries
- Delete entries
- Search with fuzzy matching (client-side via Fuse.js)

Data persistence
- User entries are stored in `data/glossary_user.json` (created on first run). Keep a copy if you move machines.

If you prefer the old static workflow
- You can still use `tools/parse_glossary.py` if you have a glossary text file; the generated static JSON can be used as a fallback when the API is not available.

Developer / tests

Run tests (use the helper or run pytest directly):

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/pytest -q
```

Notes
- The server runs on port 5000 by default. If you want to serve the app from a different host/port, edit `server.py`.
- The file `data/glossary_user.json` is created/updated by the server and is used to persist your manual entries.

Contributing
- Make a branch, make changes, run tests, and open a PR.
# ECSS Glossary — local app

Small local project to quickly search ECSS terms and abbreviations.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
# ECSS Glossary — local app

Small local project to quickly search ECSS terms and abbreviations.

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+

Quick start
1. Generate the JSON from the provided text file:

```bash
python3 tools/parse_glossary.py ecss_glossaire.txt
```

The script writes `data/glossary.json`.

2. Serve the project to open the web interface:

Recommended — serve the project root:

```bash
cd /Users/aldricparent/Documents/Spatial/ECSS
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/web/
```

Serving the project root allows the frontend (`web/index.html`) to load `data/glossary.json` located at the repository root.

Alternatively — serve only the `web` folder:

```bash
cd /Users/aldricparent/Documents/Spatial/ECSS/web
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

If you serve only `web/`, copy `data/glossary.json` into `web/data/` first:

```bash
cp ../data/glossary.json web/data/glossary.json
```

3. Search for a term on the page. The input field searches both the term and the definition.

Files added
- `tools/parse_glossary.py`: CSV parser → `data/glossary.json`.
- `web/`: minimal frontend (`index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`).
- `data/glossary.json`: generated by the parser (not committed by default).

Notes
- Opening `web/index.html` directly from the filesystem will not load `data/glossary.json` due to browser security; serve the folder with an HTTP server as shown above.

Developer / tests
-----------------

Run tests (recommended inside the provided virtual environment helper):

```bash
cd /Users/aldricparent/Documents/Spatial/ECSS
chmod +x run_tests.sh   # once
./run_tests.sh
```

This script creates a `.venv/` virtual environment, installs `pytest` from `requirements.txt` and runs the test suite.

You can also run pytest directly if you have it installed:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
```

If you add tests or change code, re-run the parse script before running the web app:

```bash
python3 tools/parse_glossary.py ecss_glossaire.txt
```

Contributing
------------
- Create a new branch for your change: `git checkout -b feat/my-change`
- Run tests locally: `./run_tests.sh`
- Commit and push, then open a PR on GitHub. CI will run the test suite automatically.

Ignored files
-------------
The repo includes a `.gitignore` which excludes the local virtual environment and generated JSON data. Don't commit `data/glossary.json` or `.venv/`.
